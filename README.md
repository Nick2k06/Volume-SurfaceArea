# Volume-SurfaceArea
Recall the formulas for volume and surface area for a rectangular solid:

Volume = length x width x height

Surface Area = 2(length x width) + 2(length x height) + 2(width x height)

Create a program that will ask the user to enter integer values for the length, width, and height of any given rectangular solid. The program will then output the volume and surface area.
